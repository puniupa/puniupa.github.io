	abstract = { There is increasing interest in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) as a tool for rehabilitation of upper limb motor functions in hemiplegic stroke patients. This type of BCI often exploits mu and beta oscillations in EEG recorded over the sensorimotor areas, and their event-related desynchronization (ERD) following motor imagery is believed to represent increased sensorimotor cortex excitability. However, it remains unclear whether the sensorimotor cortex excitability is actually correlated with ERD. Thus we assessed the association of ERD with primary motor cortex (M1) excitability during motor imagery of right wrist movement. M1 excitability was tested by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Twenty healthy participants were recruited. The participants performed 7 s of rest followed by 5 s of motor imagery and received online visual feedback of the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand M1 while performing the motor imagery task. TMS was applied to the right hand M1 when ERD exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF were recorded from the agonist muscle of the imagined hand movement. Results showed that the large ERD during wrist motor imagery was associated with significantly increased MEP amplitudes and reduced SICI but no significant changes in ICF. Thus ERD magnitude during wrist motor imagery represents M1 excitability. This study provides electrophysiological evidence that a motor imagery task involving ERD may induce changes in corticospinal excitability similar to changes accompanying actual movements. },

@article{Takemi+2024,
	abstract = {In this study, rapid topographical changes were detected in the forelimb motor maps in the primary motor cortex (M1) of awake marmoset monkeys using our previously developed accurate short-time stimulation mapping procedure (Takemi et al. 2017; Kosugi et al. 2018). The results revealed that although the hotspot (the location in M1 that elicited a forelimb muscle twitch with the lowest stimulus intensity) remained constant across postures, the stimulus intensity required to elicit the forelimb muscle twitch in the perihotspot region and the size of motor representations were posture-dependent. Hindlimb posture was particularly effective in inducing these modulations. The angle of the body axis relative to the gravitational vertical line did not alter the motor maps. These results provide a proof of concept that a rapid stimulation mapping system with chronically implanted cortical electrodes can capture the dynamic regulation of forelimb motor maps in natural conditions. The flexible nature of the motor maps necessitates the reconsideration of the results of motor control and neuroplasticity studies. Neural mechanisms regulating forelimb muscle representations in M1 by the hindlimb sensorimotor state warrant further exploration.Competing Interest StatementJU is a founder and CEO of the University Startup Company, LIFESCAPES Inc. for the research, development, and sales of rehabilitation devices including brain-computer interface.

@article{Takemi+2017,
	abstract = {<p>Cortical stimulation mapping is a valuable tool to test the functional organization of the motor cortex in both basic neurophysiology (e.g., elucidating the process of motor plasticity) and clinical practice (e.g., before resecting brain tumors involving the motor cortex). However, compilation of motor maps based on the motor threshold (MT) requires a large number of cortical stimulations and is therefore time consuming. Shortening the time for mapping may reduce stress on the subjects and unveil short-term plasticity mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to establish a cortical stimulation mapping procedure in which the time needed to identify a motor area is reduced to the order of minutes without compromising reliability. We developed an automatic motor mapping system that applies epidural cortical surface stimulations (CSSs) through one-by-one of 32 micro-electrocorticographic electrodes while examining the muscles represented in a cortical region. The next stimulus intensity was selected according to previously evoked electromyographic responses in a closed-loop fashion. CSS was repeated at 4 Hz and electromyographic responses were submitted to a newly proposed algorithm estimating the MT with smaller number of stimuli with respect to traditional approaches. The results showed that in all tested rats (<italic>n</italic> = 12) the motor area maps identified by our novel mapping procedure (novel MT algorithm and 4-Hz CSS) significantly correlated with the maps achieved by the conventional MT algorithm with 1-Hz CSS. The reliability of the both mapping methods was very high (intraclass correlation coefficients ≧0.8), while the time needed for the mapping was one-twelfth shorter with the novel method. Furthermore, the motor maps assessed by intracortical microstimulation and the novel CSS mapping procedure in two rats were compared and were also significantly correlated. Our novel mapping procedure that determined a cortical motor area within a few minutes could help to study the functional significance of short-term plasticity in motor learning and recovery from brain injuries. Besides this advantage, particularly in the case of human patients or experimental animals that are less trained to remain at rest, shorter mapping time is physically and mentally less demanding and might allow the evaluation of motor maps in awake individuals as well.</p>},

@article{Takemi+2018,
	abstract = {Bridging between brain activity and machine control, brain-computer interface (BCI) can be employed to activate distributed neural circuits implicated in a specific aspect of motor control. Using a motor imagery-based BCI paradigm, we previously found a disinhibition within the primary motor cortex contralateral to the imagined movement, as evidenced by event-related desynchronization (ERD) of oscillatory cortical activity. Yet it is unclear whether this BCI approach does selectively facilitate corticomotor representations targeted by the imagery. To address this question, we used brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation while participants performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist movements with their right hand and received online visual feedback of the ERD. Single and paired-pulse magnetic stimulation were given to the left primary motor cortex at a low or high level of ERD to assess intracortical excitability. While intracortical facilitation showed no modulation by ERD, short-latency intracortical inhibition was reduced the higher the ERD. Intracortical disinhibition was only found in the agonist muscle targeted by motor imagery at high ERD level, but not in the antagonist muscle. Single pulse motor-evoked potential was also increased the higher the ERD. However, at high ERD level, this facilitatory effect on overall corticospinal excitability was not selective to the agonist muscle. Analogous results were found in two independent experiments, in which participants either performed kinesthetic motor imagery of wrist extension or flexion. Our results showed that motor imagery-based BCI can selectively disinhibit the corticomotor output to the agonist muscle, enabling effector-specific training in patients with motor paralysis.},

@article{Palmer+2012,
	abstract = {The two hemispheres of the brain are connected via the corpus callosum; however, this pathway and its function are still not fully understood. Palmer et al. (p. 989) used a combination of optogenetic, calcium-imaging, and electrophysiological methods to investigate the cellular mechanism of interhemispheric inhibition of the firing frequency of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rats in vivo and in vitro. They discovered that this form of inhibition involved interneurons in the top layers of the cortex that suppressed active dendritic currents synergistically recruited by back-propagating action potentials. This mechanism depended upon a γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor--mediated mechanism acting on specific ion channels in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Coordinating the right and left sides of the brain is mediated by the inhibition of activation in neuronal dendrites. Interhemispheric inhibition is thought to mediate cortical rivalry between the two hemispheres through callosal input. The long-lasting form of this inhibition is believed to operate via γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors, but the process is poorly understood at the cellular level. We found that the firing of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat somatosensory cortex due to contralateral sensory stimulation was inhibited for hundreds of milliseconds when paired with ipsilateral stimulation. The inhibition acted directly on apical dendrites via layer 1 interneurons but was silent in the absence of pyramidal cell firing, relying on metabotropic inhibition of active dendritic currents recruited during neuronal activity. The results not only reveal the microcircuitry underlying interhemispheric inhibition but also demonstrate the importance of active dendritic properties for cortical output.},
